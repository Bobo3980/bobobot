# bobobot
This is a bot for Minecraft I am working on using [MineFlayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer/tree/master/) I will try to update this bot a lot and add cool features to it.

Made for the group [The Imperials](https://discord.gg/tYMF7Rb5JY)

## How to use 

Download the zip open it and take out the new folder.

install Node.js >= 14 from https://nodejs.org/en/ then:

Navigate to the folder and run

```npm install mineflayer``` & ```npm install discord-rpc``` (Required only once)

When done with that run ``` node index.js ``` put in your email, password, and server ip then you'll be good to go.

## Plans
-discord chat bridge

-UI

-mutiple accounts on mutiple servers

-make it idiot proof

-make a private version
